Why does my neural net predict this ?
How many times have you heard that neural networks are "black-boxes" and as such their usage is severely limited in safety critical applications ? It would be a shame not to use these powerful models for such reason.
PyExplain is a project that aims at making neural nets decision interpretable with a single line of code. It is based on Deep Taylor Decomposition, a method that back-propagates the relevance of each neurons for the decision.
Our implementation is in PyTorch.
